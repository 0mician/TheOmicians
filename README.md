# TheOmicians

Omics class project, mostly centered around the design of a pipeline
to analyze CRISPR regions of prokaryotes.

# Getting up and ready

For an easy (and tested) setup, ensure that you have
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed along with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Then run:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
```

From there you can recognize the folder structure of the project, and
run the scripts of the pipeline.

# Special Thanks

A special thank you to the developer of
[pilercr](http://www.drive5.com/pilercr/) for [licensing his
code](http://www.drive5.com/piler/license.htm) under a public domain
software license! Only an executable is attached to the project for
the VM, but the code is available in the aforementioned links.
