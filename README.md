# TheOmicians

Omics class project, mostly centered around the design of a pipeline
to analyze CRISPR regions of prokaryotes.

# Getting up and ready

For an easy (and tested) setup, ensure that you have
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed along with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Then run:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
```

From there you can recognize the folder structure of the project, and
run the scripts of the pipeline.

# Special Thanks

A special thank you to the developers of the tools mentioned in the [reference page](https://github.com/Milt0n/TheOmicians/blob/master/references.md) for licensing their code under
a public domain software license! Only the executables are attached to
the project for the VM, but the code is available in the
aforementioned links.
