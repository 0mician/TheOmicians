# TheOmicians

Omics class project, mostly centered around the design of a pipeline
to analyze CRISPR regions of prokaryotes.

# Getting up and ready

For an easy (and tested) setup, ensure that you have
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed along with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Then run:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
```

From there you can recognize the folder structure of the project, and
run the scripts of the pipeline.
