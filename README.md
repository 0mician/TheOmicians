# TheOmicians

Omics class project, mostly centered around the design of a pipeline
to analyze CRISPR regions of prokaryotes.

# Getting up and ready

For an easy (and tested) setup, ensure that you have
[[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] installed along with
[[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]]. Then run:

- vagrant up
- vagrant ssh
- cd /vagrant/

From there you can recognize the folder structure of the project, and run the scripts of the pipeline.
